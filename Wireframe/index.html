        <h2> purpose of a README file</h2>
        <p>
         A README file introduces and explains a project to users and developers. It provides instructions on how to install, use, and contribute to the project. It's the first place people look to understand what the project does.

        <h2>the purpose wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of a wireframe is to visually plan the layout and structure of a website or app. 
          It helps designers and developers focus on functionality, user flow, and content placement without getting distracted by colors or styling. Wireframes serve as a blueprint before the actual design and coding begin.

        <h2>a branch in Git</h2>
        <p>
          A branch in Git is a separate version of a project where you can work on changes without affecting the main codebase (usually called main or master). It allows developers to experiment, add features, or fix bugs independently.
           Once the changes are ready, the branch can be merged back into the main project.
